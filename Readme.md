# Freedrawing

### A free drawing app made with android Jetpack Compose ðŸ–Œ


This app allows to draw different figures with one finger. You can move
the canvas or zoom out with two fingers.

It is also possible to draw in **multiplayer** mode by connecting to the
[free drawing server](https://github.com/Christophe-github/FreeDrawingServer) and joining a room.



Features:

* Draw lines, circles, squares and triangles
* Possibility to have the figures filled or outlined
* Choose the line width in case of outlined figures
* Choose a color for your figures
* Activate the random color mode to randomize the color for each new figure ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ 
* Erase the last figure drawn
* Erase the whole canvas
* Zoom out or pan the view with two fingers
* Connect to the multiplayer server, join or create a room, and draw simultaneously with other people! ðŸ§‘ðŸ§‘ðŸ§‘


Multiplayer with web server relies on websockets, thanks to [Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket) for making this possible
